# MiddleColumn (4k / Large monitor friendly)

This is the only layout I use. 

Functionality:
Main rectangle that is centered.
Additional rows can be added in the main window.
A specific ratio can be set between the two main windows.
You can pin the left or right to have a maximum windows. (I usuall have two left pinned windows).

If you use the cycles Module (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.13/docs/XMonad-Actions-CycleWS.html) you can 'rotate' clockwise / anticlockwise all windows around the main window. 

Another super handy feature I have is some keybindings to select the 1st,2nd,3rd etc 'left/right' window to swap it with the master window.
