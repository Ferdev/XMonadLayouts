# XMonad Middle Column Layout (4k / Large monitor friendly)

## Functionality:
- Main rectangle that is centered.
- Additional rows can be added in the middle column.
- Set a specific ratio between rows in the middle column can be set when there are two or three windows in the middle column.
- Pin the left or right to have a maximum amount windows. (I usuall have two left pinned windows). So for example you can pin the left column to only have a maximum of two windows, of which additional windows would accumulate on the right column.
- Swop the left or right column with the middle column.
- Swop or focus a window in the left or right column by the position in the column. For example you can focus the 3rd Window in the left column.
- Set the left or right column width individually.
